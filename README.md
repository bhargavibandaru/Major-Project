# Major-Project
Detection and Isolation of Sensor attacks for Autonomous vehicles: Framework, Algorithms, and Validation
# Overview
This project investigates the cyber-security problem for autonomous vehicles under sensor attacks. It proposes a model-based framework to detect sensor attacks and identify their sources to ensure the secure localization of self-driving vehicles.
# Key Components
Sensor Redundancy             :Multiple sensors are deployed to provide real-time pose observations of the vehicle, enhancing robustness against cyber-attacks.
Attack Detectors              :A bank of attack detectors captures anomalies in each sensor measurement by combining an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) with a Cumulative Sum                                   (CUSUM) discriminator.
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)  : EKFs are employed to estimate the vehicle's position and orientation recursively.
CUSUM Discriminator           : Each CUSUM discriminator analyzes the residual generated by its combined EKF to detect deviations of the sensor measurement from the expected                                 pose.
Auxiliary Detector            : To monitor inconsistencies among multiple sensor measurements, an auxiliary detector fuses observations from multiple sensors.
Rule-Based Isolation Scheme   : Based on the results of all detectors, this scheme identifies the source of the anomalous sensor.
# Methodology
Extended Kalman Filters (EKFs)  : Used to recursively estimate the vehicle's position and orientation.
CUSUM Discriminators            : Designed to analyze the residuals generated by the EKFs, detecting potential deviations in sensor measurements.
Auxiliary Detector              : Fuses observations from multiple sensors to monitor inconsistencies.
Rule-Based Isolation            : Identifies the source of sensor anomalies based on detector results.
# Results
The effectiveness of the proposed framework has been demonstrated on real vehicle data, showcasing its capability to enhance the security and reliability of autonomous vehicle localization under sensor attack scenarios.
